Still under maintenance. The central idea is as follows

1. Created a Y bus 
2. Implemented Newton Raphson Load flow using Jacobians
3. Implemented LU decomposition to avoid the condition of having non invertible matrices
4. Used Sympy in earlier versions, however, it was becoming impossible to carry out further calculations
5. Still stuck on lines 40 and 41; Need to work on that.
